# Dice Roller App for iOS 18

## Goal

The objective of this project is to explore core programming concepts in Swift and iOS development using `Xcode 16.2` and iOS 18 SDK. This app will help reinforce fundamental coding principles while building a fully functional dice roller application.

## What you will create

We’re developing a `Las Vegas-style` dice roller app for iPhone running iOS 18. The app allows users to roll the dice either by pressing a button or by shaking their device. With this app, you’ll always have a fair way to settle any dispute on the go!

## Features

- Roll dice with a button press
- Roll dice by shaking the device
- Smooth animations for rolling dice
- Clean and modern UI following iOS 18 design guidelines
